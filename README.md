### **2. Software Development (Vitis)**
- Create a new Vitis application project using the exported hardware.
- Include VL53L0X driver and initialize the sensor via I2C.
- Read distance measurements in real time.
- Apply logic to control **RGB LEDs** and **Buzzer** based on distance thresholds.
- Build and load the application on FPGA.

### **Web Interface**
- A Flask-based application runs on the host PC.
- Reads UART data from FPGA in real time.
- Streams data to the web page using Server-Sent Events (SSE).
- Displays live statistics, logs data, and allows CSV downloads.
- Provides filtering and search options for easier analysis.
